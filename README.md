# 03_SharePoint-RichText-Formating
## Demo and M code function for dealing with Rich Text results from a direct SharePoint connection with PowerQuery and PowerBI<br>
<br>
Have you ever had to connect to a SharePoint list or library which has a Rich Text comment field? <br>
Then I also assume you have exported that same list/library to Excel and noticed that the same rich text fields are much easier to read <br>
If you are like me there must be times when you would LOVE to strip out the HTML tags from the direct Query results and display the text in a simpler way for use in some of your PowerQuery/PowerBI reports.<br>
Well great news! this is exactly what we accomplish with a "simple" custom M function included in the sample files.<br>
